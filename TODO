* Package cluster_tools:
   - Make walltime format homogeneous: h:m:s or d+h:m:s but not mix of both
   - In node information: for job information: in execution_nodes: rename mem to mem_gb
* Be more precise with what version of LL and PBS/Maui this stuff works with?
* Make document root configurable. should be easier to store js and css files
  in a non-default directory
